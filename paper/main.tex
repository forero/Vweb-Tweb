We study
the alignment of DM halos with the cosmic web as described by the
tidal and velocity shear fields. We focus on the alignment of halos
shape, spin and peculiar velocities. We use a cosmological N-body
simulation that allows to study dark matter halos spanning four orders
of magnitude in mass ($(10^{10}$-$10^{14}$) \hMsun and spatial
scales of $(0.5$-$1.0)$\hMpc to define the cosmic web. After varying
the numerical parameters in our experiments we find that the tidal
field provides a robust description for the different kinds of
alignments.  We measure a strong here is a strong alignment of the
peculiar velocity field and the halo shape with the cosmic web defined
by the tidal field. The results for the spin alignment are less
significant. The shape alignment is stronger for halos that are either
 massive ($M>10^{12}$\hMsun), have large or are located in high
 density regions.

\section{Theoretical Antecedents}
\label{sec:theory}

... There is abundant literature on the issue of shape and angular momentum
aligmnent of dark matter haloe with respect to the cosmic we.

... This alignment is often measured from the distribution of the
$\cos\theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the two axes of
interest.

... Table 1 and Table 2 summariz recent results found in the literature for
shape and angular momentum alignment, respectively.

The tidal connection between voids in simulations \citep{Platen2008},
the alignment of observed galaxies with the inferred tidal
field\citep{Lee2007,Jones2010}. There are other kind of alignment
statistics based on modifications of the correlation
\citep{Paz2008,Faltenbacher2009} that go beyond a local computation
and therefore are not reviewed in detail in this paper.

\section{N-body simulation and halo finding}


In this \documentname we use the Bolshoi volume. This is a simulation
that follows the non-linear evolution of a dark matter density field
on cosmological scales. The volume is a cubic box with 250\hMpc on a
side, the matter density field is sampled with $2048^3$ particles. The
cosmological parameters in the simulation correspond to the results
inferred from WMAP5 data, which are also consistent with the more
recent results of WMAP9. These parameters are $\Omega_m=0.27$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda} =0.73$, $\sigma_8=0.82$, $n_s=0.95$ and $h=0.70$ for the
matter density, cosmological constant, normalization of the power
spectrum, the slope in the spectrum of the primordial matter
fluctuation and the dimensionless Hubble constant. With this
conditions the mass of each dark matter particle in the simulation
corresponds to $m_p=1.4\times 10^{8}$\hMsun. 


In this paper we use groups found with a Friends-Of-Friends (FOF) halo
finder using a linking length of $b=0.17$ times the mean interparticle
separation. This choice translates into halos with a density of $570$
times the mean density at $z=0$. The measurements for the shape,
angular momentum and peculiar velocity are done using the set of
particles in each dark matter halo. The definition we use in this
\documentname for the shape comes from the diagonalization of the
reduced inertia tensor.

\begin{equation}
{\mathcal T}_{lm} = \sum_{i}\frac{x_{i,l}x_{i,m}}{R_i^2}, 
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the particle index in the halo and $l,m$ run over the
three spatial indexes  and $R_i^2 = x_{i,1}^2 + x_{i,2}^2 +
x_{i,3}^2$, where the positions are measured with respect to the
center of mass.

The spin is calculated as
\begin{equation}
\vec{J} = \sum_{i}m_p{R_i}\vec{v}_i, 
\end{equation}
where the velocities are also measured with respect to the center of
mass velocity. Finally the peculiar velocity of a halo is computed as
the center of mass velocity.


\section{The cosmic web algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}
We use two algorithms to define the cosmic web on cosmological N-body
simulations. Both are based on the same algorithmic principle, which
is determining locally a symmetric tensor which can be diagonalized to yield
three real eigenvalues $\lambda_1>\lambda_2>\lambda_3$ and their
corresponding eigenvectors ${\bf e}_{1}$, ${\bf e}_2$ and ${\bf
  e}_3$. This allows for a local classification into one of the
following four categories: void, sheet, filament and peak depending
whether the number of eigenvalues larger than a given threshold
$\lambda_{th}$ is $3$, $2$, $1$ or $0$, respectively.

We use two different symmetric tensors. The first is the shear tensor,
defined as the hessian of the gravitational potential, normalized in
such a way as to be dimensionless:

\begin{equation}
T_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial
  r_{\alpha}\partial r_{\beta}}, 
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the gravitational potential rescaled by a factor $4\pi
G\bar{\rho}=3/2\Omega_m H_{0}^2$ in such a way that the Poission
equation can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^{2}\phi  = \delta, 
\end{equation}

where $\delta$ is the matter overdensity, $\bar{\rho}$ is the average
matter density, $H_{0}$ is the Hubble constant at present time and
$\Omega_m$ is the matter density parameter.

The second tensor is the velocity shear:

\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\alpha\beta} = -\frac{1}{2H_{0}}\left(\frac{\partial
  v_{\alpha}}{\partial r_{\beta}}+ \frac{\partial v_{\beta}}{\partial
  r_{\alpha}}\right) 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Numerical considerations}

In this paper we compute the cosmic web on grids of two different
resolutions $256^3$ and $512^3$. In the case for the Tweb we interpolate



\section{Results}

\subsection{Interweb Alignment}
... We compute the pair-wise allignment between the eigenvectors in
the two web finders. 

... We also compute the alignment between the eigenvectors in cells
occupied by dark matter halos. This will be a key element in the
interpretation of the results for halo-based allignments in the next
sections: shape, angular momentum and peculiar velocities.

...

  resolutions as a function of the dark matter mass corresponding to
  the halos where the measurement was made. The error bars indicate

  eigenvector.} 
\end{figure*}

\newpage
\subsection{Angular Momentum Alignment}


\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{Fig3.pdf}
\caption{Median of $\cos\theta$ quantifying the angular momentum

  momentum vector.} 
\end{figure*}



\subsection{Peculiar velocity Alignment}

\begin{figure*}

  velocity.} 
\end{figure*}

Possible conclusion. Prolateness follow concentration. In the Tweb Angular momentum alignment is influenced by spin at higher masses. In the Vweb angular momentum alginment is influenced by all factors. In the peculiar velocity alginment only spin seemss to have an effect.

\subsection{What drives the alignment}

We wish to understand what other selection criteria on halo
properties can produce a stronger local alignment for the shape, spin
and peculiar velocities. We split the halo population into low and
high mass halos imposing a cut at $M_{\rm halo}=10^{11}$\hMsun. This
allows us to have robust statistics on the high mass end. We have also
computed these results for a cut at $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12}$\hMsun and
checked that the results we report below are not affected by this
change.

For each mass interval we perform cuts in the following properties:
spin, concentration, triaxiallity, circularity  and density. We
measure the web alignments in two sets, each one including the $30\%$
of halos in the lower/higher end of the corresponding property.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}


We do not find a strong signal for the alignment of spin and the
cosmic web. A significant correlation signal has been recently
measured between the spin and the cosmic vorticity
\citep{Libeskind2013a,Laigle2013}. This two facts are consistent with
spin being produced by the non-symmetric part of the shear and tidal
tensors.  

\section{Conclusions}

\section*{Appendix A. Detailed description of previous theoretical results}


\begin{itemize}


\item
\citep{Libeskind2013} %various alignments
Studies shape and spin alignment with the cosmic web defined by the
velocity shear tensor method described in this paper.

The simulation has $2048^3$ particles in a box of $250$\hMpc,
corresponding to a particles mass of $1.3\times 10^{8}$\hMsun.  Halos
are found using a FOF halo finder with $b=0.17$. The catalog only
include halos more massiven than $3\times 10^{9}$\hMsun.

The shape is defined from the reduced inertia tensor. Results are
reported for three mass bins $M_{\rm vir}<10^{11.5}$\hMsun,
$11^{11.5}<M_{\rm vir}<12^{12.5}\hMsun$ and $M_{\rm
  vir}>12^{12.5}\hMsun$. 

The identification of the cosmic web is done on a grid of $256^3$ with
a gaussian smoothing of $\sim 1$\hMpc over the velocity field. We
define this velocity field as the ratio of a momentum density to the
matter density field. The details of this approach are described in
the Appendix .

The aligmnet signal of the spin is very weak while the shape alignment
signal is very strong. The shape alignment is such that the eigenvector
corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue is aligned with the major
axis. This effect is stronger for more massive halos. 
In other words the major axis of a halo is aligned with a filament,
and lies on the plane that define a sheet. However the spin is
antialgined with the filament for massive halos and weakly aligned for
low mass halos. 

\item
\citep{Trowland2013}


The simulation is the millennium run, which has $2160^3$
particles in a volume of $500$\hMpc on a side. This corresponds to a
particle mass of $8.6\times 10^{8}$\hMsun. The catalog uses both halos
and subhalos which were identified with SUBFIND. Only halos with more
than 500 particles were kept to get a robust computation for the
spin. For each halo the spin is defined as the sum of the angular
momentum of each particle with respect to the center of mass.  
 

The method to define the filamentary structure is based on the
eigenvalues of the hessian of the density.However the analysis are
reported ona box of $300$\hMpc on a side. Four different gaussian
smoothing scales are used: $2.0$, $3.0$ and $5.0$\hMpc.

The authors report a slight alignment signal of spin against the
principal filament axis. By fitting the following functional form to
the $\cos(\theta)$ distribution

\begin{equation}
P(\cos\theta) =
(1-c)\sqrt{1+\frac{c}{2}}\left[1-c\left(1-\frac{3}{2}\cos^{2}\theta
  \right)\right]^{-3/2}, 
\end{equation}

they are able to quantify the degree of alignment ($c<0$) or
antialignment ($c>0$).  This parameterization is based on theoretical
expectactions of Tidal Torque Theory (TTT) \citep{Lee2005}. At $z=0$,
the reported value is $c = −0.035 \pm 0.004$, where the uncertainty
was calculated using bootstraping and resampling. 

When the halo sample is divided between low mass and high mass halos
with a transition scale $M_{\star}=5.9\times 10^{12}$\Msun, there is
an anti-alignment above this mass and an alignment below it. 


\item 
\citep{Codis2012}
Studies the alignment of the spin of dark matter halos relative to
the surrounding large scale structure and to the tidal tensor
eigenvalues.

They use a dark matter simulation with $4096^3$ DM particles in a
cubic periodic box of $2000$\hMpc on a side, which corresponds to a
particle mass of $7.7\times 10^9$\Msun. Halos are identified
using a FoF algorithm with a linking legth of 0.2 keeping all halos
with more than 40 particles, which sets the minimum halo mass to be
$3\times 10^{11}$\Msun. In their work the particles were sampled on a
$2048^3$ grid and the density field was smoothed with a gaussian
fileter over a scale of $5$\hMpc corresponding to a mass of $1.9\times
10^{14}$. The skeleton was computed over $6^{3}$ overlapping subcubes
and then reconnected.



The filament finder algorithm is based on Morse theory and defines a
Skeleton to be the set of critical lines joining the maxima of the
densit field through saddle points following the gradient. They also
compute the hessinan of the potential over the smoothed density field
to get their eigenvectors.


The spin of the halo is defined as $m_{p}\sum_{i}(r_i-\bar{r})\times
(v_i-\bar{v})$ where $\bar{r}$ is the center of mass of the halo and
$\bar{v}$ is the average velocity.

They measure the sping alignment with each one of the
eigenvectors. With repecto to the minor eigenvector $e_{1}$ there is
antialignement for masses $M>5\times10^{12}$\Msun and alignment for masses
$<5\times 10^{12}$\Msun. With respect to the intermediate eigenvector $e_2$
there is a strong alignment at high masses and no alignment for low
masses, with respecto the major eigenvector $e_{3}$ there is an
anti-alignment signal at all masses. The results from the Skeleton
algorithm are in perfect agreement with the results from the Tidal
web.  The transitional mass is weakly dependent on the smoothing scale,
varing between $1-5\times 10^{12}$\hMsun for smoothing scales between
  $1.0-5.0$\hMpc. 


\item
\citep{Zhang2009}
Study the spin and shape alignment against filaments. 

They use a dark matter simulation with $1024^3$ DM particles in a
periodic box of $100$ \hMpc on a side. The particle mass is
$6.92\times10^{7}$\hMsun. Dark matter haloes are found using a FOF
algorithm with a linking length of 0.2 times the interparticle
distance. Only halos with more than 500 particles are retained for
further analysis. 

The angular momentum is measured with positions repect to the center
of mass and the shape is determined using the non-normalized moment of
inertia tensor.

The environment is found using the hessian of the density. The density
field was interpolated over a $1024^3$ grid and then smoothed with a
Gaussian filter of scale $R_{s} = 2.1$\hMpc. There are two methods to
define the direction of a filament. The first method uses the
eigenvalues of the hessian density, howevere they define the filament
direction with the eigenvector corresponding the single positive
eigenvalue of the hessian. The second method used a line that
connects the two terminal halos in a filament segment.


The characterization of the alingment with the $\cos(\theta)$
statistic. For the method that uses the eigenvectors, they find that
the strenght of the spin alignment decreases with halo mass. For the
shape they study the alingment of the major axis with the
filament. The find an alignment signal in all mass bins, with an stronger
effect for more massive halos. 

In a final experiment they measure the spin alignment in four
different samples that separated by the strength of the shape
alignment. They find that halos anticorrelated in shape, show a strong
sping correlation going to the extreme where there is a strong spin
anticorrelation for halos with a strong shape correlation. This means
that the halos with strong spin alignment are not the same halos
showing strong shape alignment. 


\item 
\citep{AragonCalvo2007} %angular momentum alignment
The method is the Multi-scale Morphology Filter which is based on the
Hessian matrix of the density field, where the density field is
computed from the particle distribution using a Delaunay tesselation
field estimatior (DTFE), which is self-adaptive. This allows them to
identify clusters, filaments and walls.


The simulation has $512^3$ particles in a cubic box of $150$\hMpc. The
mass per particle is $2\times 10^{9}$\hMsun.  Halo identitification is
done with the HOP algorithm. They keep halos with more than $50$
partices and less than $5000$, defining a mass range of$1-100\times
10^{11}$\hMsun. 

The principal axes of each halo are computed from the non-normalized
inertia tensor. The inertian tensor and the angular momentum are
computed with respect to the center of mass of the halo. 


They compute two angles, one with respect to the direction
defining the filaments and the other the walls. Their results make a
distinction between halos of more massive and less massive than
$10^{12}$\hMsun.

The halo spins tend to lie on the plane of the wall. This is stronger
for massive halos.The effect for filaments is weaker: low mass halos
tend to lieparallel to their host filament, while high mass halos tend
to be perpendicular.  

Theres is a very strong effect for the principal axes of halos in
filaments to be strongly correlated with the direction of the
filaments. The minor axis tend to be perpendicular to the
filament. This effect is stronger for larger halos.

The effect in walls is less strong ,but still the minor axis tend to
lie perpendicular to the wall, while the other axis then to lie over
the wall. The effect is stronger for massive halos.

They find that spins and shapes of dark matter halos are significantly
correlated with each other and with the orientation of their host
structures. 



\item 
\citep{Hahn2007}% various alignments with the Tweb
The method is the Tweb. They use three simulations each of $512^3$
particles, with sizes $L_1=45$\hMpc, $L_2=90$\hMpc and
$L_3=180$\hMpc, this corresponds to particle masses of $4.7, 38.0,
300\times 10^7$\hMsun. The normalization is $\sigma_8=0.9$. Halo
identification was done with a FOF algorithm with 0.2 times the
interparticle distance. They consider halos of at least 300
particles. 

The web is obtained for a grid of $1024^3$ cells, the density field is
obtained with a CIC interpolation and smoothed using a Gaussian
Kernel. In the rest of the paper all the results correspond to a
smoothing scale of $R_{s}=2.1$\hMpc.


They Report on the angle between the halo
angular momentum vector and the eigenvector corresponding to
perpendicular directions to the sheets and the direction of the
filaments. This is divided in two halo populations: $5\times 10^{10} -
1.0\times 10^{12}$ and $>10^{12}$. There is a weak antialignment in
the case of the filaments and a stronger anti-alignment in the case of
the sheets. For the sheets the effect is stronger for the massive
bin. In the filaments the alignment is weak regardless of the
mass. They do not report any other significan statistic, but recognize
that they suffer from small-number statistics in voids).


They do not see any strong dependance of the environment in the
shape. They do not measure the shape alinment.

\item
\citep{Brunino2007}
Uses a DM only N-body simulation (the Millennium Run) to study the
shape and angular momentum alignment with respect to large
cosmological voids. 

The voids are found with a spherical void finder. This algorithm first
looks for potential void centers in the underdense regions of the
simulation. These positions define the centers of spheres that are
empty of halos above a given mass threshold. Only voids with radius
larger than $10$\hMpc were considered for further analysis.

Halos were identified by linking particles with density exceeding 900
times the background density in order to keep the analysis of shape
and angular momentum on the core of the halo. Only halos with masses
in the range $8.6\times 10^{11}\hMsun < M_{\mathrm h}< 8.6\times
10^{12}\hMsun$ were included analized to measure their angular
momentum and the inertia tensor, both in a non-normalized way.

For the purpose of measuring alignments a second cut is imposed
whereby only halos within a shell of radius $R_{\mathrm void}<r<1.05R_{\mathrm
void}$. The alignment is then measured between the vector connecting
the center of the void to the halo in question and the vector of
interest.

The results show that there is a strong alignment of halo shape in
such a way that the major axis is parallel to the shell surrounding
the void. In the case of angular momentum there is not a significant
signal for alignment.




\item
\citep{Basilakos2006}
Use a cosmological SPH+N-body simulation to measure the alignment of
cluster halos with their parent supercluster. For both the cluster
halos and parent super-cluster they define the shape via the
non-normalized inertia tensor.  The find that strenght of the
alignments increases with the degree of filamentarity of the
supercluster.

The simulation has $2\times 512^3$ particles in a box of side
$500$\hMpc. The dark matter particle mass is $6.6\times
10^{10}$\hMsun while for SPH particles is $1.2\times
10^{10}$\hMsun. The halo finding is done with a FOF algorithm with a
linking length of 0.17 and keep objects with more than 100 partcles. 


\item
\citep{Lee2002}%Obs. spin alignment
Observational measurement for the alignment of galaxy spin axes with
the local tidal shear field. For the measurement of shear, we have used
the Point Source Catalog Redshift (PSCz) survey (a complete redshift survey
from the IRAS Point Source Catalog) data. This was done down to a
radial comoving distance of $\sim 150$\hMpc.
\item
\citep{Hatton2001} %angular momentum alignment
DM matter only simulation. $256^3$ particles, $100$\hMpc, particle
mass. Look for alignment of angular momentum vectors with neighbohring
structures or other massive structures. They match halos using close
pair statistics. They do not find any evidence for a statistically
significant mutual alignment of halos on any escale.
