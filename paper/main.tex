We study
the alignment of DM halos with the cosmic web as described by the
tidal and velocity shear fields. We focus on the alignment of halos
shape, spin and peculiar velocities. We use a cosmological N-body
simulation that allows to study dark matter halos spanning four orders
of magnitude in mass ($(10^{10}$-$10^{14}$) \hMsun and spatial
scales of $(0.5$-$1.0)$\hMpc to define the cosmic web. After varying
the numerical parameters in our experiments we find that the tidal
field provides a robust description for the different kinds of
alignments.  We measure a strong here is a strong alignment of the
peculiar velocity field and the halo shape with the cosmic web defined
by the tidal field. The results for the spin alignment are less
significant. The shape alignment is stronger for halos that are either
 massive ($M>10^{12}$\hMsun), have large or are located in high
 density regions.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The formation of large scale structure in the Universe proceeds by
gravitational instability. This is an intrinsic anisotropic
process. [Pancake formation ...] 


Numerical simulations allow the exploration of a deep nonlinear
regime, following the formation of virialized dark matter halos, which
host observable galaxies. Some characteristics of these halos have to
be linked to the environment in which they formed. One way to studty
the connection halo-environment is to quantify the degree of
correlation between different halo properties and their surrounding
density and velocity fields. 


Among the properties that are of interest we find the shape, spin and
peculiar velocity. [Relevanc of dark matter halo shapes ...]
[Relevance of halo spin ...] [Relevance of peculiar velocities]

There is large tradition of theoretical precedents for the
measurements of shape and spin alignment. In this \documentname we
review most of these studyes and offer our own study with
complementary numerical techniques and simulations. [Brief summary of
  the appendix ...]

We also present the results for the alignment of peculiar velocities
with large scale structure. Such a study has received less atention in
the literature. However, we consider that it presents relevant
insights for the study of cosmic flows.

The structure of this \documentname is the following. In \S
\ref{sec:theory} we present the theoretical antecedendts for the
alignment studies we present in this paper. In \S
\ref{sec:nbody} we present the N-body
cosmological simulation and halo catalogs next to describe in
\S\ref{sec:algorithms} the two web-finding algorithms we use. In
\S\ref{sec:results} we present our main results about the alignment
of shape, spin and peculiar velocities with respect to the cosmic
web. We continue with a discussion of these results in
\S\ref{sec:discussion} paying special attention to resolution effects
and the conditions that might drive the strong alignment signals
observed in the precedent section. In \S\ref{sec:conclusions} we
present our conclusions.


\section{Theoretical Considerations: Notation and Precendents}
\label{sec:theory}

There is abundant literature on the issue of shape and angular momentum
aligmnent of dark matter haloe with respect to the cosmic web. In this
paper we focus our attention on results published during the last
decade that have made use of large N-body dark matter only
cosmological simulations. There are many works that have addressed
this problem using observational data from large surveys such as the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), however we choose to narrow our
discussion to simulation based studies which are prone to comparison.

Out of the three alignments that we study in this paper -shape,
angular momentum and peculiar velocity- only the the first two have
received wide attention in the literature, being angular momentum the
most popular with twice the number of studies for shape alignment.

These alignments are often measured from the distribution of the
$\mu=\vert\cos\theta\vert$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the two axes of
interest. This is often directly measuered as the absolute value of
the dot product between the two unit vectors along the directions
being tested, for instance in the case of angular momentum one would compute
$\mu=\vert\hat{j}\cdot\hat{n}\vert$ In the case of shape alignments the major
axis is the chosen direction to compare against the cosmic web. 

For an isotropic ditribution of the vector around the direction defined by
$\hat{n}$ the $\mu$ distribution, ranging between $0$ and $1$, should
be flat and its mean value shoud be
$\langle|mu|\rangle=0.5$. If a distribution is biased towards $1$
($\langle\vert\mu\vert\rangle>0.5$) we call this an statistical
alignment along $\hat{n}$, while in the case of a bias towards $0$
($\langle\vert\mu\vert\rangle<0.5$) we talk about an anti-alignment,
meaning an perpendicular orientations with respecto to the $\hat{n}$
direction. 

a \cite{Trowland2013} presented a parameterization for the $\mu$
distribution in the case of angular momentm alignment based on
theoretical considerations by \cite{Lee2005} (Eq. \ref{eq:distro} in
the Appendix A). Under this parameterization it was found a unique
correspondece between the full shape of the $\vert\mu\vert$
distribution and its average. In this paper we use that result to only
present the results for the average $\langle\vert\mu\vert\rangle$. 

Table 1 and Table 2 summarize recent results found in the literature for
shape and angular momentum alignment. The Appendix A includes a detailed
description of the definitions, algorithms and simulations used in
each one of these studies. In these tables the first column describe
the reference, the second column summarizes the web finding method
with a single name, the third scale associates an spatial scale to the
web finding methods, in most cases it corresponds to the grid size or
smoothing scale used to interpolate the underlying matter density or
velocity field; The fourth column indicates along which web element
(filament or wall) was measured the alignment; the fifth colume
indicates the strenght of the alignment/anti-alignment, $++$/$--$
indicate a strong alignement/anti-alignment while $+$/$-$ indicate a
weaker signal; the last columns indicates whether the described signal
is present within a defined range of halo mass.

These results can be summarized in three important points:
\begin{itemize}
\item The halo mass of $1-5\times 10^{12}$\hMsun is a threshold mass between
behaviours of no-alignment, alignment or anti-alignment.
\item Halo shape provides a strong alignment signal along filaments
  and sheets, more so for massive haloes. 
\item Halo spin tends to be oriented perpendicular to filaments and
parallel to sheets, but it is a weaker than shape alignment. 
\end{itemize}

\section{N-body simulation and halo finding}
\label{sec:nbody}

In this \documentname we use the Bolshoi simulation that follows the
non-linear evolution of a dark matter density field on cosmological
scales. The volume is a cubic box with 250\hMpc on a side, the matter
density field is sampled with $2048^3$ particles. The  
cosmological parameters in the simulation correspond to the results
inferred from WMAP5 data \citep{2009ApJS..180..306D}, which are also consistent with the more
recent results of WMAP9 \citep{2013ApJS..208...19H}. These parameters are $\Omega_m=0.27$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda} =0.73$, $\sigma_8=0.82$, $n_s=0.95$ and $h=0.70$ for the
matter density, cosmological constant, normalization of the power
spectrum, the slope in the spectrum of the primordial matter
fluctuation and the dimensionless Hubble constant. With this
conditions the mass of each dark matter particle in the simulation
corresponds to $m_p=1.4\times 10^{8}$\hMsun. A more detailed
description of the simulation can be found in
\citep{2011ApJ...740..102K}. 


In this paper we use groups found with a Friends-Of-Friends (FOF) halo
finder using a linking length of $b=0.17$ times the mean interparticle
separation. This choice translates into halos with a density of $570$
times the mean density at $z=0$. The measurements for the shape,
angular momentum and peculiar velocity are done using the set of
particles in each dark matter halo. The definition we use in this
\documentname for the shape comes from the diagonalization of the
reduced inertia tensor.

\begin{equation}
{\mathcal T}_{lm} = \sum_{i}\frac{x_{i,l}x_{i,m}}{R_i^2}, 
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the particle index in the halo and $l,m$ run over the
three spatial indexes  and $R_i^2 = x_{i,1}^2 + x_{i,2}^2 +
x_{i,3}^2$, where the positions are measured with respect to the
center of mass.

The spin is calculated as
\begin{equation}
\vec{J} = \sum_{i}m_p{R_i}\vec{v}_i, 
\end{equation}
where the velocities are also measured with respect to the center of
mass velocity. Finally the peculiar velocity of a halo is computed as
the center of mass velocity.

The halo data used in this paper is publicly available through the
MultiDark
database\footnote{\texttt{http://www.multidark.org/MultiDark/}} and is
thoroughly described in \cite{2013AN....334..691R}. 



\section{Web Finding Algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}

We use two algorithms to define the cosmic web in cosmological N-body
simulations. Both are based on the same algorithmic principle, which
determines locally a symmetric tensor which can be diagonalized to yield
three real eigenvalues $\lambda_1>\lambda_2>\lambda_3$ and their
corresponding eigenvectors ${\bf e}_{1}$, ${\bf e}_2$ and ${\bf
  e}_3$. This allows for a local classification into one of the
following four web types: void, sheet, filament and peak depending
on the number of eigenvalues larger than a given threshold
$\lambda_{th}$ is $3$, $2$, $1$ or $0$, respectively.

We use two different symmetric tensors. The first is the shear tensor,
defined as the Hessian of the gravitational potential, normalized in
such a way as to be dimensionless:

\begin{equation}
T_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial
  r_{\alpha}\partial r_{\beta}}, 
\end{equation}
%
where $\phi$ is the gravitational potential rescaled by a factor $4\pi
G\bar{\rho}=3/2\Omega_m H_{0}^2$ in such a way that the Poission
equation can be written as $\nabla^{2}\phi  = \delta$, where $\delta$
is the matter overdensity, $\bar{\rho}$ is the average matter density,
$H_{0}$ is the Hubble constant at present time and $\Omega_m$ is the
matter density parameter. A detailed presentation of this algorithm
can be found in \citep{Tweb}.

The second tensor is the velocity shear:

\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\alpha\beta} = -\frac{1}{2H_{0}}\left(\frac{\partial
  v_{\alpha}}{\partial r_{\beta}}+ \frac{\partial v_{\beta}}{\partial
  r_{\alpha}}\right), 
\end{equation}
%
where $v_{\alpha}$ correspond to the components of the peculiar
comoving velocities. With this definition the trace of the shear
tensor is minus the divergence of the velocity field normalized by the
Hubble constant $-\nabla\cdot {\bf}v /H_{0}$. A detailed description
of this algorithm can be found in \citep{Vweb}.




\subsection{Numerical considerations}

In this paper we compute the cosmic web on cubic grids of two different
resolutions $256^3$ and $512^3$. For the T-Web we interpolate first
the matter density field using a Cloud-In-Cell (CIC) scheme. Then we
smooth using a Gaussian kernel with a spatial variance equal to the
size of one grid cell. This smoothed matter density field is
transformed into Fourier space to solve the Poisson equation and find
the gravitational potential $\phi$. The Hessian is computed a finite
differences method. Finally, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
computed on each grid point.

For the V-Web we interpolate first the momentum density field over a
grid using the CIC scheme and then apply a gaussian smoothing with a
spatial variance of one grid cell. We use the matter density field,
which is also CIC interpolated and gaussian smoothed, to normalize the
momentum field. This ratio between the momentum and matter density
field is what we consider as the velocity field to compute the shear
tensor on each grid point. In this case we also compute the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors on each grid point.

\section{Our Numerical Experiments}
In this paper we use the data and the methods described above to
perform three diferent kinds of measurements.


\subsection{Preferential Alignment}

The first measurement is a rough approximation to find out along which
axes are halos aligned. We call this Preferential Alignment (PA). 

We use the fact that for a given vector under study $\hat{a}$ and the
tree eigenvectors the following identity holds  
 
\begin{equation}
(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_1)^2 +(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_2)^2 +(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_3)^2 =1.
\end{equation}
%
Using this we know that all halos can be splitted into three groups:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Halos with $(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_1)^2> (\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_2)^2$
  and $(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_1)^2> (\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_2)$, which can
  be considered to aligned mostly along $\hat{e}_1$.
\item Halos with $(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_2)^2> (\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_2)^2$
  and $(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_2)^2> (\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_3)^2$, which can
  be considered to aligned mostly along $\hat{e}_2$.
\item Halos with $(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_3)^2> (\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_1)^2$
  and $(\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_3)^2> (\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_1)^2$, which can
  be considered to aligned mostly along $\hat{e}_2$.
\end{enumerate}

If the halo population does not show any preferential alignment, then
all the halos must be evenly distributed along these three
populations. On the contrary, if there is more than one third of the
halo population in one of these sets, then we can talk about a
preferential alignment along one of the axis. However, this statistic 
does not give a precise answer on the degree of the alignment


\subsection{Average Alignment Angle}

We emphasize that all the quantities that we compute in this paper are
independent of any threshold on the eigenvalues that could be used to make a web
clasification into web types. Instead, we focus on the alignments with
respect to the eigenvectors regardless of the web type. In this
context we recall that the eigenvector $\hat{e}_1$ is vector
perpendicular to the plane defining a sheet and also a filamente and
that $\hat{e}_3$ is the vector that marks the direction of a filament
and lies on the plane of a sheet. Therefore we focus on quantifying
the degree of alignment along these two eigenvectors. 

This experiment complements the results obtained by the PA satistic by
computing the average and standard deviation of
$\vert\langle\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_1\rangle\vert$ and
$\vert\langle\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_3\rangle\vert$.  We perform this
tests in differet populations split into different mass bins
logarithmically spaced between $1\times 10^{9}$\hMsun and
$1\times10^{14}$\hMsun.  

In a separate test we make the same measurements but this time
splitting the halo sample by other properties such as:
circularity, concentration, local matter density, spin and
triaxiality. In this case we take the upper and lower $30\%$ of the
halos according to each property and measure the strenght of the
alignment by the average value of
$\vert\langle\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_1\rangle\vert$ and
$\vert\langle\hat{s}\cdot\hat{e}_3\rangle\vert$. 

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


\subsection{Preferential Alignment}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Fig0.pdf}
\caption{Fraction of halos in a mass bin that show a preferential
  alignment with respect to an eigenvector. Each row presents on of
  the three properties studied in this paper: shape (major axis),
  angular momentum and  peculiar velocity. Left column presents the
  results against the Vweb   and the right the Tweb. Strong colors
  refer to $256^3$ grid resolutions and lighter colors to a $512^3$
  grid. The thick black horizontal line at $0.33$ corresponds to the
  expected fraction for a random vector field.
\label{fig:preferential}}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:preferential} presents all the results for the
preferential alignment (PA) summarizing to a good extent the main
results of this paper. 

For shape alignment and the Tweb (upper row, right column) we find a strong
preferential alignment along the third eigenvector $\vec{e}_{3}$. This
signal incresases steadily with mass and is almost independent of the
grid resolution. At high masses between $70\%$ and $100\%$ of the
halos have their major axis aligned along $\vec{e}_{3}$ which means
that they mostly lie along filaments and sheets. 

The shape alignment and the Vweb (upper row, left column) gives a
different perspective. Firstly, there seems to be little evidence
for an alignment for masses below $10^{11}-10^{12}$\hMsun, depending
on the grid resolution. Secondly, the alignment at higher masses goes
along the first eigenvector $\vec{e}_{1}$ meaning that they mostly lie
perpendicular to the filaments and sheets. In the discussion section
we clarify this result that at first might seem puzzling.

For fhe angular momentum alignment and the Tweb (middle row, right
column) we find that at low masses $<10^{12}$\hMsun no evidence for
any alignment. At higher masses $>10^{12}$\hMsun there is weak signal
of preferential alignment along the first and second eigenvectors,
between $35\%$ to $45\%$ of the halos are aligned with respect to
$\vec{e}_1$ and $\vec{e}_2$. Correspondingly, between $10\%$ to $20\%$
of the halos are aligned along respect to $\vec{e}_{3}$. This means
that most of the halos are perpendicular to the filaments and do not
have a clear alignment with respect to walls.

The angular momentum in the Vweb (middle row, left column) presents a
a signal of alignment along the second eigenvector $\hat{e}_{2}$,
between $45\%$ to $60\%$ of the halos are aligned along that
direction. While there is a minority of halos aligned with
$\vec{e}_{1}$.  There a clear change in trends around
$10^{11}$\hMsun-$10^{12}$\hMsun depending on the grid resolution;
below that mass range there is no evidence for alignment while at
higher masses appear all the trends we describe. This means that most
of the halos tend to lie along walls but do not have a clear alignment
with respect to filaments.

The peculiar velocities show a weak but consistent alignment along the
third eigenvector $\vec{e}_{3}$ of the Tweb for all masses below
$10^{13.0}$\hMsun-$10^{13.5}$\hMsun depending on the grid
resolution. $45\%$ of the halos are aligned while only $25\%$ are
aligned along the first eigenvector $\vec{e}_1$. This suggests that
halos tend to move along filaments and parallel to the walls, except
at higher masses where the alignments get randomized.  In contrast,
the peculiar velocities with respect to the Vweb show the same trend
but weaker and only for low mass halos $<10^{12}$.


In the next subsections we present a complementary account of this
results by presenting quantitative results of the average angle
between vector pairs describing the alignments discussed so far.


\subsection{Shape Alignment}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Fig2.pdf}
\caption{Median of $\cos\theta$ quantifying the shape alignment for
  the Vweb (left) and the Tweb (right) at two different grid
  resolutions. In the upper (lower) panels the angle $\theta$ is
  measured between the halo major axis and the first (third)
  eigenvector.\label{fig:shape_alignment}} 
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:shape_alignment} presents the main results for the
angles between the first and third eigenvectors and the major shape
axis as a function of halo mass. 

In the case of the Vweb (left column) we have a clear alignment with
respect to the first eigenvector at high masses $>10^{12}\hMsun$, with
values $\muavg\approx 0.8$ well above the expected value of $0.5$ for
random distribution. With respect to the third eigenvector we measure
an anti-alignment with $\muavg\approx0.3$. For low masses
$<10^{12}\hMsun$ we do not detect any aligmnent signal. This is 
consistent with the PA results of massive halos
perpendicular to filaments and parallel to walls.

The Tweb (right column) show alignment trends starting at masses of
$10^{10}$\hMsun, two orders of magnitude less than the V-web. In this
case we measure an alignment along the third eigenvectors and an
antialignment along the first eigenvector. In the later case at the
highest mases $\muavg\approx 0.8$ while in the former $\muavg\approx
0.2$. This strong alignment/antialignment signal mirrors the
interpretation from the PA results that describe halos lying parallel
both to filaments and walls.


\subsection{Angular Momentum Alignment}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Fig3.pdf}
\caption{Median of $|\cos\theta|$ quantifying the angular momentum
  alingment for the Vweb (left) and the Tweb (right) for two different
  grid resolutions. In the upper (lower) panels the angle $\theta$ is
  measured between the first (third) eivenvector and the angular
  momentum vector.\label{fig:spin_alignment}} 
\end{figure*}


We now take a look at the angular momentum alignment. Figure
\ref{fig:spin_alignment} shows the results as a function of halo mass
following the same panel distributio as in Figure
\ref{fig:shape_alignment}. In all cases we see that these alignment
trends are weaker than shape alignments. For the Vweb low mass halos
$<10^{12}$\hMsun do not show any preferential alignment with the
cosmic web. Halos more massive than this threshold have their angular
momentum slightly perpendicular to the direction defined by the first
eigenvector and uncorrelated to the third eigenvector. This translates
into a weak tendency for the angular momentum to lie parallel to walls.

In the case of the Tweb, the alignment for low mass halos $<10^{12}$\hMsun 
is also absent. More massive halos present a weak alignment along
first eigen vector and anti-alignment with the third eigenvector. This
provides a quantitative expression of the results derived from the
preferential alignment whereby the angular momentum is weakly
perpendicular to filaments.

\subsection{Peculiar velocity Alignment}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Fig4.pdf}
\caption{Median of $\vert\cos\theta\vert$ quantifying the peculiar velocity
  alignment with the Vweb (left) and the Tweb (right) for two different
  grid resolutions. In the upper (lower) panels the angle $\theta$ is
  measured between the first (third) eivenvector and a halo's peculiar
  velocity.
\label{fig:velocity_alignment}} 
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:velocity_alignment} shows the results for peculiar
velocities alignments. In the case of the Vweb, the peculiar
velocities show a weak signal of aligmnent ($\muavg\approx0.55$)
along the third eigenvector for low masses $<10^{12}$\Msun and a weak
antialigment at higher masses. The strengt of the alignment also shows
clear dependency on the grid size used to compute the web.

The Tweb shows a stronger alignment with the third eignenvecor at all
masses with $\muavg\approx0.6$ and an antialignment with the first
eigenvector with $\muavg\approx 0.4$. In contrast to the Vweb results,
these trends remain baiscally unchanged at all masses and grid
resolutions, with only minor change for halos masses $>10^{13}$\hMsun.

\subsection{What drives the alignment}

We wish to understand what other selection criteria on halo
properties can produce a stronger local alignment for the shape, spin
and peculiar velocities. We split the halo population into low and
high mass halos imposing a cut at $M_{\rm halo}=10^{11}$\hMsun. This
allows us to have robust statistics on the high mass end. We have also
computed these results for a cut at $M_{\rm halo}=10^{12}$\hMsun and
checked that the results we report below are not affected by this
change.

For each mass interval we perform cuts in the following properties:
spin, concentration, triaxiallity, circularity  and density. We
measure the web alignments in two sets, each one including the $30\%$
of halos in the lower/higher end of the corresponding property.




\begin{figure*}

\caption{The alignment is always taken with respect to the first eigenvector.}
\end{figure*}
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}


We do not find a strong signal for the alignment of spin and the
cosmic web. A significant correlation signal has been recently
measured between the spin and the cosmic vorticity
\citep{Libeskind2013a,Laigle2013}. This two facts are consistent with
spin being produced by the non-symmetric part of the shear and tidal
tensors.  




\subsection{Interweb Alignment}

In the first place we wish to directly compare the results of the two
algorithms. For the two algorithms we have the information for the
eigenvectors and the eigenvalues on exactly the same positions defined
by the grids. This allows us tocompute the pair-wise allignment
between the eigenvectors in the two web finders. 

We are mainly interested in the alginment of the web with
the halos. Therefore we restrict our analysis to the grid cells that are
occupied by halos. If we had decided to perform this kind of analysis
on all the grid cells, the statistics would be dominated by the void
regions, because the dominate in number the fraction of cells in the
simuation.

Figure \ref{fig:interweb} shows the results of the inter-web alignment
as a function of halo mass. It clearly stands out that the
eigenvectors are aligned for low mass halos but are close perpendicular to
each other at the location of the most massive halos. There is a
transition scale around $(10^{11.5}-10^{12.5})$\hMsun depending on the
grid resolution. The coarse grid $(256^3)$shows the transition at higher masses
than the fine grid $(512^3)$.  


For both resolutions, the halos more massiven than $10^{13}$\hMsun are
locate in regions where the fastest momentum-weighted collapse
direction (defined by the V-web) is perpendicular to the direction
where the tidal compression is the highest. 

The fact that this trend is less evident at low resolution and low
masses, hints that the flip is actually related to the overdensity
values, i.e. to the degree of non-linearity, in the corresponding
spatial scales.



Possible conclusion. Prolateness follow concentration. In the Tweb
Angular momentum alignment is influenced by spin at higher masses. In
the Vweb angular momentum alginment is influenced by all factors. In
the peculiar velocity alginment only spin seemss to have an effect.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have examined the alignment of shape, angular momentum and peculiar
velocity of dark matter halos with respect to the cosmic
web. We use publicly available data from two algorithms
implemented on a large cosmological N-body simulation to study halo
populations spanning five orders of magnitude in mass. The first
algorithm uses the tidal field and the second the velocity shear, both
present local results on scales of $0.5$\hMpc to $1.0$\hMpc.

\section*{Appendix A. Detailed description of previous theoretical results}


The tidal connection between voids in simulations \citep{Platen2008},
the alignment of observed galaxies with the inferred tidal
field\citep{Lee2007,Jones2010}. There are other kind of alignment
statistics based on modifications of the correlation
\citep{Paz2008,Faltenbacher2009} that go beyond a local computation
and therefore are not reviewed in detail in this paper.

\begin{itemize}


\item
\citep{Libeskind2013} %various alignments
Studies shape and spin alignment with the cosmic web defined by the
velocity shear tensor method described in this paper.

The simulation has $2048^3$ particles in a box of $250$\hMpc,
corresponding to a particles mass of $1.3\times 10^{8}$\hMsun.  Halos
are found using a FOF halo finder with $b=0.17$. The catalog only
include halos more massiven than $3\times 10^{9}$\hMsun.

The shape is defined from the reduced inertia tensor. Results are
reported for three mass bins $M_{\rm vir}<10^{11.5}$\hMsun,
$11^{11.5}<M_{\rm vir}<12^{12.5}\hMsun$ and $M_{\rm
  vir}>12^{12.5}\hMsun$. 

The identification of the cosmic web is done on a grid of $256^3$ with
a gaussian smoothing of $\sim 1$\hMpc over the velocity field. We
define this velocity field as the ratio of a momentum density to the
matter density field. The details of this approach are described in
the Appendix .

The aligmnet signal of the spin is very weak while the shape alignment
signal is very strong. The shape alignment is such that the eigenvector
corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue is aligned with the major
axis. This effect is stronger for more massive halos. 
In other words the major axis of a halo is aligned with a filament,
and lies on the plane that define a sheet. However the spin is
antialgined with the filament for massive halos and weakly aligned for
low mass halos. 

\item
\citep{Trowland2013}


The simulation is the millennium run, which has $2160^3$
particles in a volume of $500$\hMpc on a side. This corresponds to a
particle mass of $8.6\times 10^{8}$\hMsun. The catalog uses both halos
and subhalos which were identified with SUBFIND. Only halos with more
than 500 particles were kept to get a robust computation for the
spin. For each halo the spin is defined as the sum of the angular
momentum of each particle with respect to the center of mass.  
 

The method to define the filamentary structure is based on the
eigenvalues of the hessian of the density.However the analysis are
reported ona box of $300$\hMpc on a side. Four different gaussian
smoothing scales are used: $2.0$, $3.0$ and $5.0$\hMpc.

The authors report a slight alignment signal of spin against the
principal filament axis. By fitting the following functional form to
the $\cos(\theta)$ distribution

\begin{equation}
P(\cos\theta) =
(1-c)\sqrt{1+\frac{c}{2}}\left[1-c\left(1-\frac{3}{2}\cos^{2}\theta
  \right)\right]^{-3/2}, 
\label{eq:distro}
\end{equation}

they are able to quantify the degree of alignment ($c<0$) or
antialignment ($c>0$).  This parameterization is based on theoretical
expectactions of Tidal Torque Theory (TTT) \citep{Lee2005}. At $z=0$,
the reported value is $c = −0.035 \pm 0.004$, where the uncertainty
was calculated using bootstraping and resampling. 

When the halo sample is divided between low mass and high mass halos
with a transition scale $M_{\star}=5.9\times 10^{12}$\Msun, there is
an anti-alignment above this mass and an alignment below it. 


\item 
\citep{Codis2012}
Studies the alignment of the spin of dark matter halos relative to
the surrounding large scale structure and to the tidal tensor
eigenvalues.

They use a dark matter simulation with $4096^3$ DM particles in a
cubic periodic box of $2000$\hMpc on a side, which corresponds to a
particle mass of $7.7\times 10^9$\Msun. Halos are identified
using a FoF algorithm with a linking legth of 0.2 keeping all halos
with more than 40 particles, which sets the minimum halo mass to be
$3\times 10^{11}$\Msun. In their work the particles were sampled on a
$2048^3$ grid and the density field was smoothed with a gaussian
fileter over a scale of $5$\hMpc corresponding to a mass of $1.9\times
10^{14}$. The skeleton was computed over $6^{3}$ overlapping subcubes
and then reconnected.



The filament finder algorithm is based on Morse theory and defines a
Skeleton to be the set of critical lines joining the maxima of the
densit field through saddle points following the gradient. They also
compute the hessinan of the potential over the smoothed density field
to get their eigenvectors.


The spin of the halo is defined as $m_{p}\sum_{i}(r_i-\bar{r})\times
(v_i-\bar{v})$ where $\bar{r}$ is the center of mass of the halo and
$\bar{v}$ is the average velocity.

They measure the sping alignment with each one of the
eigenvectors. With repecto to the minor eigenvector $e_{1}$ there is
antialignement for masses $M>5\times10^{12}$\Msun and alignment for masses
$<5\times 10^{12}$\Msun. With respect to the intermediate eigenvector $e_2$
there is a strong alignment at high masses and no alignment for low
masses, with respecto the major eigenvector $e_{3}$ there is an
anti-alignment signal at all masses. The results from the Skeleton
algorithm are in perfect agreement with the results from the Tidal
web.  The transitional mass is weakly dependent on the smoothing scale,
varing between $1-5\times 10^{12}$\hMsun for smoothing scales between
  $1.0-5.0$\hMpc. 


\item
\citep{Zhang2009}
Study the spin and shape alignment against filaments. 

They use a dark matter simulation with $1024^3$ DM particles in a
periodic box of $100$ \hMpc on a side. The particle mass is
$6.92\times10^{7}$\hMsun. Dark matter haloes are found using a FOF
algorithm with a linking length of 0.2 times the interparticle
distance. Only halos with more than 500 particles are retained for
further analysis. 

The angular momentum is measured with positions repect to the center
of mass and the shape is determined using the non-normalized moment of
inertia tensor.

The environment is found using the hessian of the density. The density
field was interpolated over a $1024^3$ grid and then smoothed with a
Gaussian filter of scale $R_{s} = 2.1$\hMpc. There are two methods to
define the direction of a filament. The first method uses the
eigenvalues of the hessian density, howevere they define the filament
direction with the eigenvector corresponding the single positive
eigenvalue of the hessian. The second method used a line that
connects the two terminal halos in a filament segment.


The characterization of the alingment with the $\cos(\theta)$
statistic. For the method that uses the eigenvectors, they find that
the strenght of the spin alignment decreases with halo mass. For the
shape they study the alingment of the major axis with the
filament. The find an alignment signal in all mass bins, with an stronger
effect for more massive halos. 

In a final experiment they measure the spin alignment in four
different samples that separated by the strength of the shape
alignment. They find that halos anticorrelated in shape, show a strong
sping correlation going to the extreme where there is a strong spin
anticorrelation for halos with a strong shape correlation. This means
that the halos with strong spin alignment are not the same halos
showing strong shape alignment. 


\item 
\citep{AragonCalvo2007} %angular momentum alignment
The method is the Multi-scale Morphology Filter which is based on the
Hessian matrix of the density field, where the density field is
computed from the particle distribution using a Delaunay tesselation
field estimatior (DTFE), which is self-adaptive. This allows them to
identify clusters, filaments and walls.


The simulation has $512^3$ particles in a cubic box of $150$\hMpc. The
mass per particle is $2\times 10^{9}$\hMsun.  Halo identitification is
done with the HOP algorithm. They keep halos with more than $50$
partices and less than $5000$, defining a mass range of$1-100\times
10^{11}$\hMsun. 

The principal axes of each halo are computed from the non-normalized
inertia tensor. The inertian tensor and the angular momentum are
computed with respect to the center of mass of the halo. 


They compute two angles, one with respect to the direction
defining the filaments and the other the walls. Their results make a
distinction between halos of more massive and less massive than
$10^{12}$\hMsun.

The halo spins tend to lie on the plane of the wall. This is stronger
for massive halos.The effect for filaments is weaker: low mass halos
tend to lieparallel to their host filament, while high mass halos tend
to be perpendicular.  

Theres is a very strong effect for the principal axes of halos in
filaments to be strongly correlated with the direction of the
filaments. The minor axis tend to be perpendicular to the
filament. This effect is stronger for larger halos.

The effect in walls is less strong ,but still the minor axis tend to
lie perpendicular to the wall, while the other axis then to lie over
the wall. The effect is stronger for massive halos.

They find that spins and shapes of dark matter halos are significantly
correlated with each other and with the orientation of their host
structures. 



\item 
\citep{Hahn2007}% various alignments with the Tweb
The method is the Tweb. They use three simulations each of $512^3$
particles, with sizes $L_1=45$\hMpc, $L_2=90$\hMpc and
$L_3=180$\hMpc, this corresponds to particle masses of $4.7, 38.0,
300\times 10^7$\hMsun. The normalization is $\sigma_8=0.9$. Halo
identification was done with a FOF algorithm with 0.2 times the
interparticle distance. They consider halos of at least 300
particles. 

The web is obtained for a grid of $1024^3$ cells, the density field is
obtained with a CIC interpolation and smoothed using a Gaussian
Kernel. In the rest of the paper all the results correspond to a
smoothing scale of $R_{s}=2.1$\hMpc.


They Report on the angle between the halo
angular momentum vector and the eigenvector corresponding to
perpendicular directions to the sheets and the direction of the
filaments. This is divided in two halo populations: $5\times 10^{10} -
1.0\times 10^{12}$ and $>10^{12}$. There is a weak antialignment in
the case of the filaments and a stronger anti-alignment in the case of
the sheets. For the sheets the effect is stronger for the massive
bin. In the filaments the alignment is weak regardless of the
mass. They do not report any other significan statistic, but recognize
that they suffer from small-number statistics in voids).


They do not see any strong dependance of the environment in the
shape. They do not measure the shape alinment.

\item
\citep{Brunino2007}
Uses a DM only N-body simulation (the Millennium Run) to study the
shape and angular momentum alignment with respect to large
cosmological voids. 

The voids are found with a spherical void finder. This algorithm first
looks for potential void centers in the underdense regions of the
simulation. These positions define the centers of spheres that are
empty of halos above a given mass threshold. Only voids with radius
larger than $10$\hMpc were considered for further analysis.

Halos were identified by linking particles with density exceeding 900
times the background density in order to keep the analysis of shape
and angular momentum on the core of the halo. Only halos with masses
in the range $8.6\times 10^{11}\hMsun < M_{\mathrm h}< 8.6\times
10^{12}\hMsun$ were included analized to measure their angular
momentum and the inertia tensor, both in a non-normalized way.

For the purpose of measuring alignments a second cut is imposed
whereby only halos within a shell of radius $R_{\mathrm void}<r<1.05R_{\mathrm
void}$. The alignment is then measured between the vector connecting
the center of the void to the halo in question and the vector of
interest.

The results show that there is a strong alignment of halo shape in
such a way that the major axis is parallel to the shell surrounding
the void. In the case of angular momentum there is not a significant
signal for alignment.




\item
\citep{Basilakos2006}
Use a cosmological SPH+N-body simulation to measure the alignment of
cluster halos with their parent supercluster. For both the cluster
halos and parent super-cluster they define the shape via the
non-normalized inertia tensor.  The find that strenght of the
alignments increases with the degree of filamentarity of the
supercluster.

The simulation has $2\times 512^3$ particles in a box of side
$500$\hMpc. The dark matter particle mass is $6.6\times
10^{10}$\hMsun while for SPH particles is $1.2\times
10^{10}$\hMsun. The halo finding is done with a FOF algorithm with a
linking length of 0.17 and keep objects with more than 100 partcles. 


\item
\citep{Lee2002}%Obs. spin alignment
Observational measurement for the alignment of galaxy spin axes with
the local tidal shear field. For the measurement of shear, we have used
the Point Source Catalog Redshift (PSCz) survey (a complete redshift survey
from the IRAS Point Source Catalog) data. This was done down to a
radial comoving distance of $\sim 150$\hMpc.
\item
\citep{Hatton2001} %angular momentum alignment
DM matter only simulation. $256^3$ particles, $100$\hMpc, particle
mass. Look for alignment of angular momentum vectors with neighbohring
structures or other massive structures. They match halos using close
pair statistics. They do not find any evidence for a statistically
significant mutual alignment of halos on any escale.
